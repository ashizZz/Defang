## Overview

The Defang Extension is a browser extension designed to enhance your web browsing experience by automatically defanging (i.e., making safe to display or use) IP addresses and URLs that you encounter while browsing the web. It simplifies the process of safely interacting with potentially harmful or sensitive links.

## Features

**Automatic Defanging:** When you select text that appears to be an IP address or URL, the extension will automatically defang it by replacing certain characters, such as dots and slashes, with safe alternatives.

**Clipboard Copy:** The defanged text is automatically copied to your clipboard for easy pasting into emails, documents, or other applications.

**Simplified User Interface:** The extension keeps the user interface simple and unobtrusive, focusing on enhancing your browsing experience without unnecessary distractions.

## Installation

**Supported Browsers**
 1. Google Chrome 
 2. Mozilla Firefox
